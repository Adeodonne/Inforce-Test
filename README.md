1. Used localstorage to save info about products
2. Did not have time to implement product editing and data validation
3. Had bug with alias, thats why used relative imports
4. Use Feature-sliced design as project structure(https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview)
5. Also for styles used tailwind, to make them faster
